In this repository you will find a detailed explanation of how Spring Core roughly works from the inside 
and its key functionality. You will be able to understand exactly how Spring finds beans, creates beans, 
and how it manages their life cycle when working with annotations. 

Additionally, Spring Application Context functionality is included, which allows you to handle events.

In the spring-framework package you can find:
1. Spring bean factory
2. Bean life cycle
3. Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
4. Using classic Spring annotations to create beans
5. Application Context
6. Event Handling

In the usage-example package you can find an example of the classic use of the Spring Framework 
when working with service beans that contain some business logic. The example also shows intervention 
in the life cycle of beans and event handling.
